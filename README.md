**About Me**

Hello! I'm Mukshud Ahamed, a researcher deeply engaged in the confluence of biology, quantum physics, and climate science. My primary research delves into the intricate details of the mycobacterial cell envelope, particularly focusing on identifying cell surface proteins and understanding the evolution of protein superfamilies critical for outer membrane biogenesis.

Beyond the lab, I'm passionate about exploring how quantum phenomena might influence complex biological systems, such as corals. I'm also committed to addressing the pressing issue of climate change, with a keen interest in its impact on vulnerable ecosystems like coral reefs.

**Research Interests**
* **Microbiology:** Investigating the cell envelope of mycobacteria, protein evolution, and mechanisms of outer membrane biogenesis.
* **Quantum Biology:** Exploring the potential role of quantum effects in biological systems and their implications.
* **Coral Biology:** Studying coral biochemistry, medicinal compounds, and the impacts of climate change on coral ecosystems.
* **Climate Change:** Understanding the effects of climate change and developing strategies for mitigation and adaptation.

**Current Projects**
* **PhD Thesis:** Focusing on the identification and characterization of cell surface proteins and the evolution of protein families in mycobacteria.
* **Coral Research:** Integrating higher-order organisms into coral reef systems to study ecosystem dynamics and resilience.
* **Quantum Biology Exploration:** Investigating the intersection of quantum physics and biology, with a particular focus on corals.
